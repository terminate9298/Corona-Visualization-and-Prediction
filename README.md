# COVID (Forecasting and Visualizor)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/terminate9298/Corona-Visualization-and-Prediction)
[![Colab Link](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HvnooQjlOgoL4mGvIG7K7ckq3cG5cyY4?usp=sharing)

COVID -19 Emerged as a Biggest Disaster of 2020 Influencing Millions of Lives either By Economy or Health. This Colab Provide some Inside of how it all started and Where are we now.

# New Features!

  - Implemented SEIR Epidemic Model
  - Implemented SEIRD Epidemic Model
  - Implemented Prophet Model on Timeseries Data.
  - Implemented Auto Regression Model.
  - Implemented Simple Exponential Model.
  - Implemented Holt's Exponential Model.
  - Implemented Prediction by Exponential Smoothing.
  - Implemented SARIMAX Model.
  - Implemented Theta Model.

You can also:
  - Visualize the Distribution by Bar plot or Line Plot of States of India On Given Day.
  - Visualize top Countries with Covid on Any Day.
  - Much More.......

### Tech

This Colab uses  a number of open source Libraries and Dataset to work properly:

* [Matplotlib] - To Visualize the Plot
* [Seaborn] - To Build indepth Graphs
* [Plotly] - To Build Interactive Graphs
* [Pandas] - To Manage the Datasets
* [Numpy] - More Basic Operations
* [FBProphet] - To Model the Prophet on Time Series Dataset
* [Scipy] - Optimize the Epidemic Models

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!


### Todos

 - Implement SEIRHD Epidemic Model
 - Implement Plotly Graphs in Colab (Done)
 - Better Build the Forms in Colab (Done)
 - Build Video from Dataset 
 - Implement More Sklearn Models (Tried, Not Working)
 - Implement LSTM Models over Data
